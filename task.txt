Answers: 

1. 

- A framework provides a structured foundation for building an application, while a library is a collection of reusable code components that developers can use into their applications to perform specific tasks essentially, a framework tells you "how" to build something, while a library provides tools to help you build it. 

- Control flow:
In a framework, the framework controls the application flow, calling your code when needed, whereas in a library, you explicitly call the library functions when you want to use them. 

- Scope:
Frameworks tend to be larger and more comprehensive, providing a structure for the entire application, while libraries are usually smaller and focused on specific functionalities. 

- Flexibility:
Libraries offer more flexibility as you can choose how and when to use their functions, while frameworks are more opinionated and require you to follow their predefined structure.

 Features like concurrent rendering, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG) improve performance for large-scale apps.

React is an excellent choice for both small projects and large enterprise applications because of its flexibility, ease of use, and scalability.
