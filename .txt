What is React?

- React is a JS libraru for building UI, primarily maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of devs. It allows devs to build dynamic, responsive web apps efficiently

Why React was created?

React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, A SE at Facebook. The primary goal was to address issues with performance and complexity in Facebook's web applications

-Problem Facebook Faced: The increasing complexity of Facebook's UI led to performance issues with traditional JS and jQuery solutions

- Solution: React introduced a novel approach called the virtual DOM, which improved performance and allowed devs to think of their UIs as a tree of reusable components 

React was open sourced in 2013 and has since become one of the most popular libraries for front end dev

Core concepts:

1. Component Based architecture:

- React apps are built using components: Small, reusable pieces of UI 
- Components can be functional or class based 

2. Declarative programming:

- Instead of manually manipulating the DOM, devs define what the UI should look like, and React takes care of updating the DOM 

3. Virtual DOM:

- React uses a lightweight, in memory representation of the DOM 
- When the state of a component changes, React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and updates only the necessary parts 

4. JSX (JavaScript XML):

- React uses a syntax extension called JSX which allows html like code to coexist with JS logic 

- Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

5. Unidirectional data folow:

- React's data flow is one way making it easier to understand and debug apps 

6. State and Props 

- State: Represents the dynamic data of a component
- Props: Allows components to communicate with each other by passing data.
